DriverPass is a company looking to improve driver training by offering online training material as well as the ability for users to register for in-person on the road training. The client of this project is Liam (DriverPass Owner).

One thing that was done well in this project was collecting and organizing the requirements of the client. Being able to refer to the DriverPass interview transcript made it much easier to create the Gantt chart and keep track of project tasks.

One area I would revise is the Gantt chart. It was my first time making a Gantt chart but I think that I could have made it neater and easier to understand if I went back and took my time.

User needs are important when designing because you want to create a system that is user-friendly.

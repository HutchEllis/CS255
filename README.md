DriverPass is a company looking to improve driver training by offering online training material as well as the ability for users to register for in-person on the road training. The client of this project is Liam (DriverPass Owner).

One thing that was done well in this project was collecting and organizing the requirements of the client. Being able to refer to the DriverPass interview transcript made it much easier to create the Gantt chart and keep track of project tasks.

One area I would revise is the Gantt chart. It was my first time making a Gantt chart but I think that I could have made it neater and easier to understand if I went back and took my time.

Understanding all requirements and needs of a project is important when designing because it ensures the project meets the expectations of DriverPass.

When designing software, I would first gather requirements and analyze it. In this course I learned several different modelling types to base requirements around such as UML class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams. Each of these diagrams helps to give a better illustration of the system and helps to further knowledge of the system.
